- **Growth Tracking**: Users can track their babies' weight and height and compare these measurements with standard ranges for their age.

## Contribution

- **System Design**: Created the overall system architecture and user interface design.
- **Database Development**: Designed and implemented the database schema in Firebase to store user and baby information securely.
- **Backend Implementation**: Developed the backend logic using Java to handle data processing, notifications, and user authentication.
